Furthermore, the data collection was made possible by Yahoo Finance and Thomson Reuters Eikon. Specifically, Yahoo Finance enabled the search for stock values and Thomson Reuters Eikon provided the earnings call transcripts. Lastly, the dataset can be used as a benchmark for the evaluation of several NLP techniques to understand their potential for financial applications. Moreover, it is also possible to expand the dataset by extending the period in which the data originated following a similar procedure.\n", "citation": "@data{TJE0D0_2021,\nauthor = {Roozen, Dexter and Lelli, Francesco},\npublisher = {DataverseNL},\ntitle = {{Stock Values and Earnings Call Transcripts: a Sentiment Analysis Dataset}},\nyear = {2021},\nversion = {V1},\ndoi = {10.34894/TJE0D0},\nurl = {https://doi.org/10.34894/TJE0D0}\n}\n", "homepage": "https://dataverse.nl/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.34894/TJE0D0", "license": " CC0 1.0", "features": {"company": {"dtype": "string", "_type": "Value"}, "date": {"dtype": "date64", "_type": "Value"}, "transcript": {"dtype": "string", "_type": "Value"}}, "builder_name": "parquet", "dataset_name": "earnings_call", "config_name": "transcripts", "version": "1.1.0", "splits": {"train": {"name": "train", "num_bytes": 9592380, "num_examples": 150, "dataset_name": "earnings_call"}, "test": {"name": "test", "num_bytes": 2458569, "num_examples": 38, "dataset_name": "earnings_call"}}, "download_checksums": {"hf://datasets/jlh-ibm/earnings_call@525dbcb662f9e0f0e6682a08605706bdbd665cf1/transcripts/train/0000.parquet": {"num_bytes": 4280234, "checksum": null}, "hf://datasets/jlh-ibm/earnings_call@525dbcb662f9e0f0e6682a08605706bdbd665cf1/transcripts/test/0000.parquet": {"num_bytes": 1115378, "checksum": null}}, "download_size": 5395612, "dataset_size": 12050949, "size_in_bytes": 17446561}
